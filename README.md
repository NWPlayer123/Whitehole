#Whitehole
=========

##What is Whitehole?
Whitehole is a 3D Level Editor for Super Mario Galaxy 1/2 made by StapleButter, with help from Dirbaio, Ninjifox, and others.

Whitehole currently supports editing whole galaxies or individual zones, and editing current objects as well as adding or removing objects.
It also has a built-in BCSV Editor that will let experiences users do whatever they want.

That said, it has an important feature that makes it much easier to use than Anarchy in the Galaxy - it can render galaxies and zones as they appear in-game, and even let you interact with and move objects without caring about their coordinates.

However, Whitehole currently doesn't support as many object types as Anarchy in the Galaxy, but this will be improved in future releases.

##How do I compile the latest version of Whitehole?
The project uses Netbeans to build releases, so head over to https://www.netbeans.org/ and download the latest version, and you're on your way, just download the repo and open it up as a project.

##Where can I go if I have further questions?
The main forums are at http://www.kuribo64.net/ and we have an IRC channel at irc.nolimitzone.com on #SMG2.5
